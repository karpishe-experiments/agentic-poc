# M3 — Pages, runner UI and advisory evaluation

**State:** Planned. **Coverage:** J11–J13; AC01–AC02, AC05–AC07, AC10–AC12.
**Predecessor:** [M2](M2-references.md). Apply [EXECUTION](EXECUTION.md).

## Entry gate

Reconcile M2's subject artifacts, accepted references, image transport and grant
rules. Require all three simulated reference-package exits. Verify Dify file
inputs can carry the relevant reference set and judge image set using fixture
requests, without a paid provider. Resolve attachment/size limits before coding
around them. Bundle any private binding/login handoff and staging grants up front.

## Page contracts to finalize at entry

Read pinned Ali guidelines 11–13. Manuscript units are not physical pages.

- J11 book artifact: fixed geometry/canvas, typography/bubble system, safe regions,
  ordered physical pages including cover, panels per page, narrative-unit mapping,
  and subject/reference routing. Default square canvas; physical page IDs are
  assigned once by Booklet. Parent has one two-panel page; Creator has at least two
  multi-panel pages. A panel is composition inside one image, not another image job.
- J12 page-subject artifact: ordered panels with action/composition, character and
  location IDs, exact lettering elements (kind/text/speaker/placement), reference
  IDs, and exact accepted source versions. Require J11 and all applicable sources.
- J13 page-subject artifact: assembled prompt, unchanged style hash, ordered
  reference roles, input versions, job/operation IDs, candidate/final asset lineage,
  warning list and current per-page approval. Require accepted J12 for that page.

Cover is page index zero and participates in J11–J13, including title lettering
and approval. It is not a fourteenth specialist or an export package. Completion
requires exactly cover + 3/5/8 story page assets and current approvals, plus the
earlier required artifacts/reference assets. No PDF/ready-for-export transition.

Store exact source text in request evidence; do not normalize approved lettering
while assembling prompts. Incorrect rendering is reported as a warning. A missing
text field or reference is a structural error before the request. Use every relevant
approved reference and no unrelated subject's reference. Do not substitute textual
descriptions when the configured image path cannot accept image references.

## Scheduling, review and evaluation

Implement both one-page and ordered selected-batch scheduling, using existing
jobs/items with the M1 operation ledger. Batches run sequentially; every page
has its own result and approval. A later failure does not erase earlier results.
Test kid page-by-page, parent selected batch and creator a subset plus remainder.

Tester can group approvals under a recorded grant or request bounded revision.
A page-specific change invalidates only that page and its image; a shared change
invalidates actual descendants. Revision counter increments once per tester
revision request, not once per invalidated image; every replacement image still
uses its own image-request allowance. Technical safe retries do not consume the
creative revision allowance but do consume provider requests when a call occurs.

At generation completion, schedule separate tester feedback and judge operations.
Judge branch receives the fixed brief, dialogue/decisions, warning and usage
evidence, all final page/cover images and reference packages. It has independent
instructions and no manager mutation tools. To keep context bounded, supply
structured artifact summaries plus exact final lettering, not every historical
version. Preserve links to full history. Do not omit final images silently to fit
a limit; verify supported image count/size or split into recorded bounded judge
observations followed by one final assessment, counting every real call.

Reports use `{summary,intent,consistency,interaction,costEvidence,findings}`;
each finding links affected artifact/page/version and has a concise explanation.
Use `not_assessed` when evidence is absent. No passing score is required. Label
simulated feedback as simulated. Judge failure leaves generation completed and
evaluation failed; final experiment acceptance still needs retained reports.

## UI and execution work

1. Add J11–J13 schemas, prompts, fixtures, source routing and completion predicate.
2. Connect image operations to page jobs and exact per-page approvals.
3. Add feedback/judge branches, result validators and separate evaluation status.
4. Complete runner list/detail: persona/mode, one/all personas, current task,
   warnings, remaining limits, Pause/Resume, conversation/decision provenance,
   failed/predecessor/successor runs, saved booklet and artifact/image links.
5. Render image at its actual aspect ratio. Recovery diagnostics expose operation
   and Dify run IDs, not credentials/raw provider responses. Keep API-driven tester
   feedback separate from browser usability evidence.
6. Add a test driver `scripts/experiment-runner.ts` using the same application APIs
   as the UI: create/observe/pause/resume/assert. It must not invent another flow
   engine or call providers directly. All-persona execution is a sequential queue.
7. Publish, deploy and run all three full Simulated cases on staging. Save actual
   application/Dify run IDs and normal booklet IDs.

## Verification and exit

Focused tests cover each J11–J13 clarification/draft/revision contract and prove
multi-panel layouts remain one image, cover completion,
exact lettering/style propagation, reference attachment membership, selected-batch
order, duplicate completion, stale dependency rejection and scoped revision.
Test pause/restart around a completed page, unavailable assets, corrupt output,
storage failure, unknown provider outcome, cap exhaustion, warning-bearing success
and failed judge without loss of generation success.

Browser test through the runner: launch, inspect progress, pause/resume, reload,
open saved booklet/pages, inspect warnings and reports. Do not claim a Playwright
test-list discovery as browser execution. Use the existing e2e runner with a focused
new spec, fixtures and no providers; record a separate authorized staging browser
smoke through the live Dify simulated branch.

The current `scripts/run-e2e.ts` starts `next start` and seeds local agents.
Adapt its explicit experiment test profile to start a development server and
initialize v2 fixture data without agent seeds. Keep the existing profile for
unaffected tests. This permits focused browser execution without inserting a
production build into validation. Test cleanup still stops the isolated server
and MongoDB. Do not run the current wrapper unchanged and assume it tests v2.

Exit: all cases have the required current simulated packages corresponding to
9/11/15 baseline images, all thirteen responsibilities,
page-specific approvals, reports and no PDF requirement. Typecheck/lint/focused
tests, two clean reviews, CI/deployment/check and staging evidence pass. Revise M4
with measured steps/context sizes and verified result/usage schemas.
Retain superseded and replacement assets as history; total stored image count may
exceed the baseline after revisions. All simulated generation attempts still count
against logical request limits. Do not reject completion for retained history.
